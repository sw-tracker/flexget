#WD My Cloud

To be able to use WD My Cloud with Ubuntu we need the device to have a static IP address. In my case this was easy because my router supports `Address Reservation`:
```
LAN Setup -> Add Address Reservation -> Click on the device -> Reserve IP 192.168.1.51
```

Then re-boot all devices: PC, router and hard-disk.
