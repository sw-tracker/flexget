# VPN

## How to setup a VPN

Install OpenVPN:

```
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

Create credentials file and change its file permissions so it is only owned by root
```
sudo vim /etc/openvpn/login.txt
sudo chmod 700 /etc/openvpn/login.txt
```

in the file enter (replace with correct values):
```
username
password
```

## Use Private Internet Access

https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/

```
sudo apt-get install openvpn
cd /etc/openvpn
sudo wget https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip
sudo unzip openvpn.zip
ls -l
sudo openvpn 'config-filename-goes-here.ovpn'
```

It will then ask you for your username and password, or you can enter them directly:
```
cd /etc/openvpn
sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/Sweden.ovpn --auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/login.txt
```

You should get:
```

# AutoStart on Boot

OpenVpn comes with an autostart, it just needs to be enabled. By default, the autostart will load a daemon for each `conf` file found in `/etc/openvpn`. In my case, I will only have one called `server.conf`.

Edit the file below:
```
sudo vim /etc/default/openvpn
```

Uncomment the line below (remove the #):
```
AUTOSTART="all"
```

Then tell the daemon to load the new settings:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then create `server.conf` from one of the `ovpn` files provided by the VPN provider. Let's say you choose `Switzerland.ovpn`:
```
cd /etc/openvpn
sudo cp Switzerland.ovpn server.conf
```

Then let's add the username/password to `server.conf` so the connection happens automatically.
```
sudo vim /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```

The file should already have a setting like `auth-user-pass`, please replace it with:
```
auth-user-pass login.txt
```

You can test that the correct credentials are being loaded like this (it should connect without asking for username/password):
```
sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```

Now reboot and go to the verify section.

# Verify VPN

Open a new terminal and type:
```
sudo wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -
```

You should get the same IP address as return during the openvpn command output line:
```
Wed May 4 08:42:37 2016 UDPv4 link remote: [AF_INET]185.3.135.34:1194
```

# Tests for IP Leakage

https://www.iplocation.net/
https://www.browserleaks.com/webrtc

To fix webrtc:

Chrome: Install ScriptSafe extension

Firefox: type `about:config` on browser address box. Set `media.peerconnection.enabled` setting to false.

# Start/Stop

```
sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn stop
sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn start
```

If we need to connect to a different exit point (country), edit the `server.conf` file:
```
sudo vim /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```

And change `remote italy.privateinternetaccess.com 1198` to the desired country name.
Check available country names in `/etc/openvpn/`.
