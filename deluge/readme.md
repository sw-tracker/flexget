##How to install Deluge (v1.3.x) headless on Ubuntu Server

Deluge is a great BitTorrent client that you can install on Ubuntu to allow you to share your favourite files with the rest of the BitTorrent community.

In the newer versions of Ubuntu, Deluge comes in two parts; the server (also called the daemon) and the user interface. This means you can install the Deluge daemon as a headless service and then control it from a remote machine. You can either control the daemon using the Deluge client itself (for example the Windows version of Deluge) or alternatively you can use your browser to control it. If you've not installed VNC and are running a purely headless setup then running Deluge headless is pretty much your only option! So, here's how you install it:

At the time of writing Deluge version 1.3.11 is the most up to date release for Trusty Tahr 14.04LTS.

So, first off we need to create a new user called "deluge" and perform a couple more steps:

```
sudo adduser --disabled-password --system --home /var/lib/deluge --gecos "SamRo Deluge server" --group deluge

sudo touch /var/log/deluged.log

sudo touch /var/log/deluge-web.log

sudo chown deluge:deluge /var/log/deluge*

sudo chown -R deluge:deluge /media* (where your media is)
sudo chmod -R u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx /media/
```

Add any users that you would like to be able to see files downloaded by deluge to the deluge group, for example, if using plex:
```
sudo usermod -a -G deluge plex
```

##Install the Deluge Daemon

Next we'll install the Deluge daemon itself:

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install deluged
```

Next we'll install the Web interface by typing:

```
sudo apt-get install deluge-webui
```

##Run the Deluge Daemon on startup

Now we've got the components installed we need to make everything run on start-up. So, let's create the first script we need by typing the following command:

```
sudo vim /etc/init/deluged.conf
```

This will create a file called deluged.conf. Next, assuming you're using Putty, highlight the following commands, right-click on them and select Copy

```
# deluged - Deluge daemon
#
# The daemon component of Deluge BitTorrent client. Deluge UI clients
# connect to this daemon via DelugeRPC protocol.

description "Deluge daemon"
author "Deluge Team"

start on filesystem and static-network-up
stop on runlevel [016]

respawn
respawn limit 5 30

env uid=deluge
env gid=deluge
env umask=002

exec start-stop-daemon -S -c $uid:$gid -k $umask -x /usr/bin/deluged -- -d
```

Toggle back to the Putty Session and press the [Insert] key once and add a couple of blank lines by pressing the [Enter] key. Next right click and the lines we've just copied above will be pasted into the file.

Now press the [Esc] key once and type :wq to save and quit out of the script. If you make a mistake editing the file then issue :q! instead of :wq to abort your changes.

You may wish to modify the above `umask` as it applies to any files downloaded by deluged:
- 007 grants full access to the user and members of the group deluged is running as (in this case deluge) and prevents access from all other accounts.
- 002 grants full access to the user and the group deluged is running as and only read access to other accounts.
- 022 grants full access to the user deluged is running as and only read access to other accounts.
- 000 grants full access to all accounts. 

##Create the Web start-up script

Now we need to create the script to launch the web user interface:

```
sudo vim /etc/init/deluge-web.conf
```

This will create a file called deluge-web.conf

Next highlight the following commands, right-click on them and select Copy

```
# deluge-web - Deluge Web UI
#
# The Web UI component of Deluge BitTorrent client, connects to deluged and
# provides a web application interface for users. Default url: http://localhost:8112

description "Deluge Web UI"
author "Deluge Team"

start on started deluged
stop on stopping deluged

respawn
respawn limit 5 30

env uid=deluge
env gid=deluge
env umask=027

exec start-stop-daemon -S -c $uid:$gid -k $umask -x /usr/bin/deluge-web
```

Toggle back to the Putty Session and press the [Insert] key once and add a couple of blank lines by pressing the [Enter] key. Next right click and the lines we've just copied above will be pasted into the file.

Now press the [Esc] key once and type :wq to save and quit out of the script. If you make a mistake editing the file then issue :q! instead of :wq to abort your changes.

umask 027 grants full access to uid, read access to gid and prevents access from all other accounts. This should only affect the permissions of plugins installed through the Web UI and, if enabled, logs. Group permissions are restricted to read-only to prevent compromised member accounts injecting malicious code into plugins or modifying the logs.

Cross your fingers and restart the server by typing the following command:

```
sudo reboot -h now
```

##Accessing Deluge via the web interface

You should now be able to access the Web front-end for Deluge by typing http://MyMediaserver:8112 into the address bar of your browser where MyMediaserver is the name you gave to your server when you installed Ubuntu. Alternatively the IP address of the server works just as well.

You should now be presented with the Deluge login-screen. Enter deluge for the password and you should then see a screen.

##Opening the correct ports on your router

In order to start downloading Torrents you need to open up some ports on your router. If you click on the Preferences icon (the screwdriver/spanner) on the Deluge web interface and select Network, the Incoming Ports (the From: and To: ports inclusively) are the ports you need to open on your router. You can obviously change these ports if so wish, but make sure they match your router settings. Make sure you also uncheck the Use Random Ports option if you're going to be opening a specific port range on your router.

###Starting and stopping the deluge daemon:

If at any time you want to stop the deluge daemon then you can do so by issuing the following command:

```
sudo stop deluged
```

To start it again use start instead of stop in the above command.

###Starting and stopping the web daemon:

If at any time you want to stop the web daemon then use the following command:

```
sudo stop deluge-web
```

To start it again use start instead of stop in the above command.
