#Start plex on browser:
http://127.0.0.1:32400/web/index.html#

#Start plex
~/bin/plexhometheater.sh

#Add media folder

Make sure you add the media folder to the getsubs.sh script chmod command, so that plex can see newly added files from deluge.

#Add Plex User To Deluge Group
Give plex user access or it cant read the new episodes added by deluge:
```
sudo usermod -a -G plex deluge
```

#Start PHT on boot
Copy this file to this location:
```
/home/olga/.config/autostart/plexhometheater.sh.desktop
```

*Important:* Do not user '~' in the desktop file.

#Troubleshoot
